0,5,My thoughts about TikTok,False,2022-05-10 02:13:27,ljk55Chevygirl,"I am enjoying this app so much ... I am completely entertained ... although I am new to this ... someday I wanna make a video Well January 2021 is here... although I am enjoying this app... I don’t appreciate being censored and told that I have shared enough when I know it is censorship I am enjoying this app very much.. but why is it that when I follow someone that I stop seeing them in my “following” section?!?!? Time for another evaluation... ok .. so, I do enjoy TikTok very much... I enjoy having the ability to follow and possibly to help people on here Yes... I am so glad that I have had the opportunity to meet sone awesome people on this app I enjoy this app but I don’t understand why I don’t see people that I am following for extended periods of time and I have to go and search for them to catch up!!!! Is this how it works? When I follow an account they stop showing up for me? I have to go look them up.. otherwise I do enjoy this app Good times Well here is another eval…. So, yes I enjoy this app! I like this app
May9, 2022
I don’t understand why someone on here says see part 2 at the link below… I go to it ( NEVER TGE SAME ONE TWICE) and it is a private account… I NEVER GET ACCEPTED if I follow… besides ( IF I DID) it wouldn’t matter anyway… BECAUSE THE NEXT ONE LINKS TO A NEW ACCOUNT… it is so stupid and I just don’t get it!!!!"
1,4,Amazing app (Bad addiction),False,2022-05-01 15:39:25,Novicakes,"Honestly tiktok  is a great app but is overall very addicting I feel like the preview of the app looks very nice but once you download the app it takes over daily task and makes them harder. 
I love being able to share videos and watch tons of people’s creations, but compared to what the preview tells you the app is very different you get banned for small things and have your videos taken down but there’s nudity all over  tiktok that has yet to be taken down, I get it’s just a body but kids shouldn’t have to experience such things like that yet there are also very rude people and they shouldn’t have to be bullied either. Also  tiktok  can honestly take over small easy task like cleaning  it’s honestly very addicting and all you do after you delete it is download it back, Some people aren’t able to small task as easily as others and tiktok just makes that harder for them like lack of motivation is a real struggle and staying up all night isn’t something that helps. When you reach  10k+ you get creator funds but honestly you don’t get that much money I get it’s a 1-2 minute video but lots of influencers and artist etc work hard on a lot of those videos just to get like 16$ on a video. 
And I’m not trying to blame the app creators it’s basically the people on the app but this is just the stuff that happens on the app and needs to be banned and the creators need to start getting more money than what they actually get."
2,4,"Mass updates, Schedule posts, & Studio",False,2022-05-27 22:36:07,GreenJewel123,"Instead of having only a few users get updates at a time and doing rollouts, I feel like everyone should get the updates at the same time. I still haven’t gotten the option to repost videos or create playlists while some of my friends have. But then they also have the issue where I’m able to upload the 3 and 10 minutes videos and create stories but they haven’t gotten those updates yet. I also feel like we should be able to schedule our posts on the app. I know we’re able to do it on the desktop but most of us use the app on our phones so it doesn’t make sense that we wouldn’t be able to have that option. On tumblr we’re able to put our posts in a queue or schedule them to be released at a specific time. If we had that option it would make it easier to make posts consistently without us having to worry about timing.

I really enjoy the new Studio that’s been implemented, however I believe a major flaw in it is that when we decide to edit a clip and start over is that we can’t hear the section of audio of said clip while re-recording. Before Studio we had that option automatically applied so when we record something again, we can make sure the timing is right, especially if we’re lip syncing. Now we can’t hear anything while recording again so we have to hope for the best or just start the entire video over from scratch."
3,4,It’s amazing. Just needs a bit of a dim,False,2022-01-18 04:07:26,Poom Pooh,I really enjoy this social media platform. The app is amazing and a great way to socialize with people all around the world. it’s all wonderful. What I do have a problem with is how quick this app can take down a harmless video. And yet the traumatizing video of a dog being ripped to shreds in broad daylight seemed like it took forever to be taken off. I remember getting one of my videos taken down because it had one swearword in it. It got taken down a day after I posted it. But it took groups of people to make videos under the sound for the video to get taken off of tiktok. A lot of people complained about being disturbed after seeing the video. I mean how could you not? It was nothing but sick. I won’t going to detail about it. This isn’t the first issue either. It took a good week for a A video with a edited audio from the game. The person who made it made it seem like the child was having sex with a character that was supposedly known as an adult. Either way that doesn’t make it OK. They even made two videos just with a different character. There’s even an account still up today where there’re making animation videos about the child and the character dating. All I’m saying is I love this app. I’ve gained a lot of confidence from it and I’m happy with my account. I just think tiktok needs to be a little bit quicker and concerned about the gruesome videos and disgusting ones uploaded.
4,4,TikTok is okay.,False,2022-09-09 19:34:03,Netflixnights,I do love TikTok and I really adore TikTok like this like I can see why this is one of the most social media apps this is one of the most popular social media apps an email I love this like this is a very nice app I love it all the way but of course to this app there’s some major downs and when I say major there might be a teensy bit of downs but there’s some major downs and I am going to express my feelings in this review. A lot of things is like smaller accounts and getting banned because what happens is if you have an a smaller account you could do the most little stuff and get banned permanently banned for it and what happens is the bigger account they don’t get banned but you wanna know why because if they got if those of big accounts or even huge account got banned what’s going to happen is that’s going to ruin tick-tock‘s reputation. Not only that they don’t wanna tell you why you was permanently banned they just say oh well. And expect you to sit there and act like it’s OK when they don’t even show you or tell you what the problem is. TikTok is very addictive and I learned this very very fast people going around stealing and killing breaking all this violence that’s going around and yet the account it’s the big accounts that will post stuff like that they’re OK they’re just left OK nothing happens to them but one small accounts once they post something like that now all of a sudden it’s ban ban ban
5,4,I love the honesty of the people on TikTok,False,2022-01-22 20:24:30,Shalanda Albert,"I like TikTok. I feel that the people here are real and that’s what I need. 
What I don’t like is how TikTok will mute your videos. It seems they do it when you begin to grow fast all of a sudden you began to slow down and I feel they put your videos out when they want to. I’m self employed, I have a son graduating this year,I’m writing a book and looking to relocate so I can’t put videos out at a certain time or stay current on the trends but my videos should be pushed as well. I have a video that was my first 1.5 views and when it got there TikTok muted it. Why? When I can’t post new content I will repost an old video to try and keep my followers. The other videos haven’t been muted but they muted the growing ones. This has happened so much at first I almost gave up but because of the people on here, I stayed. I don’t feel I’ll ever go viral but honestly once I can give more I will however when I was giving my videos was being muted and continued to get violations. I’ve had to constantly appeal things in the beginning. Like I said I love the people on TikTok don’t know how happy I am with the people who get paid to watch our videos and get paid. They want you to pay to get boosted but I want to earn my followers and likes. I did this to help with my mental and at first it began to effect it when you’re trying so hard but kept getting muted but now I’m learning."
6,3,TikTok,False,2022-06-25 23:27:07,Kaley Bradshaw,"Writing this review I feel bad giving only 3 stars, considering I’m literally obsessed with this app, but there are some major problems (in my opinion) with it. First of all, the app is addicting. I’ve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could’ve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it’s partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads “open” instead of “update”. I’m very frustrated when I can’t participate in trends because I’m still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn’t perfect but if there’s an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn’t the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can’t stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind. The app allows you to express your creativity and learn to do things you would’ve never thought you would need to know. I believe if these two things could be improved, then TikTok will be the perfect app for people to use as a way to get involved and be their true selves."
7,3,Oh no. The moderation system. It’s broken!,False,2022-01-23 17:01:00,Taylor's Playlist,"I’ve been on TikTok since 2019 and it has its ups and downs. I had a some videos go viral which is pretty cool, but the algorithm is so unpredictable sometimes that most of my content is barely seen even with the use of trends and huge amounts of effort. My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It’s unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I’ve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for “violence” even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It’s as if they didn’t read the actual email at all. Overall, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells now when I post content. It takes the joy out of it. TikTok, if you’re actually reading this, PLEASE fix this. You are literally hurting the community’s content creators."
8,3,Social Work student here!,False,2021-06-21 23:34:58,Zanna .,"For all of the hype that surrounds TikTok, it is an incredibly interesting app that plays a major role in the life of most adolescents today. It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‘side’ of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch."
9,5,I spend 13 hours a day on this app,False,2022-05-16 03:49:49,fkxjudiwofk,"I never do reviews for apps, but I must for this one because I’ve never been more entertained and worse more time on a single individual app like I have TikTok!!  It’s jus so fun and entertaining, so many dif kinda people on there si everything is hand made for every single person to find similar interest to their own and each account holder/tik tok user has their for you page, which are page(s) curated to each individuals interest etc; I must say the curation and accuracy of the algorithm of this app is right up their with Twitter; but I’d say even better/high than Twitter. Twitter gets pretty repetitive, that’s why I love tik tok; TikTok is always showing brand-new stuff all the time and doesn’t repeat interests!! Such as for; it doesn’t repeat anything you’ve liked or interacted with, even the ads are new every time but you will have your occasional “oh I’ve seen this one before” ad! AD; not video!! Video is always brand new never seen before, content is always updated and curated to you personally daily!! I love this app I could on & on; 

  Long sorry short; this app never misses; you’ve got your favorite personal interest; updated daily with a humongous variety; top tier comedy on this platform too; it’s the main social platform these days. 10/10"
10,4,Janners67,False,2022-09-26 22:48:51,janners1,"I have been addicted to TikTok since I started end of February last year. The tools we can use, the great songs, the content ideas and tips and tricks help everyone find their talents and creativity. I wish they'd communicate with us a little better, actually I wish they'd communicate period when were doing something they don't like instead of just giving a violation or taking us off fyp for periods of time. Still very little communication, I'm contemplating going to another app in fear that they'll take my account without warning like they have so many of my friends. My violations have mainly been duets that I did when they were over 500k to multiple millions of views, how would I think that there was anything wrong if you guys let it get that high. We can touch sound or use video on duets so we shouldn't be penalized. Same with sounds TikTok recommends. They decide it's no longer ok and we get penalized? Can we please have ability to get rid of bunches of fake followers at one time or be able to filter out people with less than amt followers or under age 25. These kids are so disrespectful and rude and make fun of people and call names. Just give them there own space. I'll put out video showing how to hold screen and put not interested. I will teach what you want me to and would love to ask questions and get black and white answers"
11,4,And getting banned,False,2022-06-14 04:08:01,xbjxjdndndn,I keep getting banned for no reason on this app and I’m getting sick of tired of it I want just a regular account that gets abuse I don’t want no banding processes in my account I hate how my account gets banned every single time I make a new account and now I can’t even make a new account what should I do I ran out of resources and I just don’t know what to do I wish the banding thing was never there so I can just have a normal TickTock account I know it’s there for safety reasons that TickTock has a band button or a record button but people are using it for a vantage to make people get banned for no reason it’s a good app that I read it a 4 i’m just saying like the band in the report button thing is not good just don’t report people for no reason report people if they’re doing bad things or abusing or something like that i’m not trying to do anything to TikTok I would just like them to do something with the band and important but and help me get my account back this band button got me banned four times and I’m getting sick of tired of people banding people for no reason it’s just not fair I feel like they’re just jealous of our followers and it’s getting on my nerves how people just keep banding us we shouldn’t be banned for this I know I’m 12 but like I would just like to not have my account banned by people that think it’s funny

13,5,I like tiktok a lot better than Fb,False,2022-06-23 15:07:13,Nanamills51,"I can say what I feel about what I don’t like about what the president is doing to our country without being band from my account. I can say how I feel about my love for Jesus and not get band. I can say how I feel about my fears of the Covid and without getting band from my account. I can say how I feel about my fear of getting the vaccine shot without getting band from my account. At first I was completely against getting the shot, but after I was aloud to hear all sides . I decided to get them. I was completely against them to start with simply because Biden ,dr foulice ,( I know I didn’t spell his name right but I don’t care) and Harris are soo dishonest , with us , and flat out lied to the American people so much that we couldn’t and can’t trust a word they say! Then he starts to demand us to get it while letting everyone at the border walk in with nothing. He has shown the American people that he doesn’t care about us at all, if we live or die while he gives everything to anyone coming in at the borders. So thank you for letting me be able to make videos expressing how I feel! I am a Born again Christian, and I love my God given Freedom of speech! I’m 70 years old so I’m ready to go to Heaven, it’s a shame Biden isn’t! Thank you so much tiktok"
14,4,"like most social media, but has flaws.",False,2022-03-08 16:18:21,Random Chan,"ive used this app since musically, and honestly its grown to be a part of my life. the platform doesnt selfishly do everything they can to keep people on the app and even has an ad to get people to make sure theyre taking breaks. (“HOLD ON, youve been scrolling for way too long now!!” lol) the app has so many different communities and has helped new artists get out there and even made brand new artists songs go viral. the app has so much potential. the problem is their system and the way the fyp works. what happens is, when one of your videos are viewed multiple times by people and they like it or comment, the video is shared to peoples pages with similar interests. this means that if the first few people that see your video are uninterested and scroll, the video likely wont show up on many more for you pages. another system they have that is flawed is when you upload a video from your camera roll. when you upload a video from your camera roll, tik tok looks for similar videos due to plagarism. if they find a video similar or the same then they mark it as plagurism and share it to nobodys fyp. this is shadow banning. many peoples videos are put down with this feature. other than that, this app is a well programed and far more entertaining than other social media."
15,3,Amazing (buttttt),False,2022-05-27 00:41:09,HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IM MOOOOOON,"I would give this 5 because I love tiktok I love being able to talk to my friends to share videos to post & see my views and likes to know that I’m doing just okay to see my feed back to know that what I’m doing is right and I’m not alone but there’s are some bad parts about being a tiktoker or well me a gachatoker so let’s get into the bad parts there’s a lot of hate that comes with posting a lot of stuff you have to do and then you over think what are you doing wrong to get so much hate what are you doing right to have so much support & if your like me you don’t think you deserve so much you think your videos are cringe when a lot of people says you aren’t when you wanna do a face reveal but tiktok makes you so insecure there are videos with the sound “this you, this you?” And people exposing there haters like what and now you got a lot of people like me addicted, sleep deprived, and just feeling horrible & you also let women twerk, be naked, be in a bikini, breastfeed, there boobs out and apparently this is a children’s app yes nothing is wrong with breastfeeding if this was an adult app cause it’s just showing a mothers Journey but there are 10-15 year olds seeing this that is very inappropriate if you ask me and you ban people for no reason if anything ban those people also TOO MANY UPDATES like just no they are so bad like please stop updating the app thank you<3"
16,4,Great app,False,2022-07-24 15:42:49,aelyn r,"Tiktok is a very famous app and has entertaining content that you can find on your fyp. There are some videos that aren’t appropriate for kids under the age of 11, but in order to fix this, you can restrict time limits and what videos they can see. If your kid is super addicted to tiktok, or is on the app 24/7, deleting the app or account is not the solution. This has happened to me once, on accident. I thought tiktok was deleted and I was really sad because tiktok was my favorite  app and I watched it a lot and made many videos on my account. Parents, don’t delete their accounts or apps. Don’t go farther then that. If you go on tiktok settings, you can set time limits and restrictions and you can set it to where your kid can see videos appropriate for THEIR age. Don’t scroll through your kids phone, even I they look worried or guilty that your scrolling on it, they are not always doing something bad in it or inappropriate things. Sometimes they are just nervous you’ll delete the app or account, or lose their online friendships. You can also download tiktok so you can see what your kid posts, and gain them a new follower ! Anyway, the tiktok app is amazing and you can make many friends on this app and express your feelings and post about your life, or maybe gaming! Overall, I love tiktok and this app is amazing!"
17,4,Definitely A Great App But.....,False,2020-12-29 03:58:34,Suazo Sofia,"Okay, here’s my review. This APP IS WONDERFUL. But there are some down sides to it. So, I deleted this app once but I wanted it back so I can use it on my spare time. So I just got it back and apparently I can’t get back into my old account. I saved all the data but the password doesn’t work. I’ve tried a bunch of times. It’s probably a bug. Anyways, my second “but” is that even if you don’t want an account and your trust trying out the app, don’t pull up the pop-up that says “SIGN UP” or “LOGIN IN”. I honestly don’t want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext. At this time-period, you don’t have anywhere to be, or anything to do besides hang with your roommates (roommate), family members, or yourself. Trust me, it’s tough. But at this point social-media is our life now to figure out things and to learn more. (This probably has nothing to do but I’m trying to give ideas and my opinions). Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don’t want to see the pop-up where it says to “SIGN IN” or to “LOGIN IN”. Please don’t get me wrong but this app is incredible because I use it on other devices. But this device I use daily needs this app! Thanks for letting me share my review. Hope it’s well enough for ideas. Stay safe! Happy Holidays!!!

-Your fellow TikTok Fan."
18,3,"The app is astounding, but...",False,2021-12-15 19:23:36,enhpad13,"I love TikTok; it is one of my favorite apps. However, TikTok randomly asked me to confirm my age, for some reason (which wouldn’t normally bother me because I had already confirmed it before),  so I confirmed my age. I put in my real date of birth (I’m 13 years old) and TikTok made my account private, made it to where people are unable to duet, stitch, or download my videos, and I can neither send nor receive messages. I completely understand that TikTok doesn’t want young children to get access to the app and post videos with their face or make unintelligent choices, but I have not done anything against TikTok’s policies or spread any negative energy. I am unable to send videos and messages to my friends or receive videos and messages from my friends. This has also happened to one of my old friends; someone reported him for being under the age limit (he is 13 years old) and TikTok private’s his account. I completely understand if you want people who are 13 years of age or younger to have privacy and not share personal information, but it doesn’t make sense that there are only some people (around 13 years old) that are being forced to have their accounts private’s when others do not also have to go through this. Thank you for taking the time to read this (I will change my star-rating to a 5/5 stars if this issue is fixed)."
19,2,its good but the  banning videos that aren’t even breaking the community guidelines,False,2022-07-21 05:08:48,the0ddone0ut_,"i’ve had tiktok since it was called musically, it’s amazing and I love posting videos on it. The people on it are amazing but the thing about it is that i’ve posten my kitten on it with a little happy song, and it gotten taken down for “child safety” it’s literally a kitten? i don’t understand it. I’ve seen literal naked women on this app and my videos get taken down because of a kitten?! seriously? i’ve also posted a tiktok here recently of me and my sister doing a transition video of us getting ready for the day and it has gotten taken down. Now my account is on a risk of getting permanently banned. This is so stupid, i really do not understand it. Other than that it’s an amazing app, but still fix that. I’ve sent an appeal but they said they couldn’t do anything about it and that i did break the community guidelines. Please stop banning my accounts because of this, i've seen so many worse things that or against minor safety but apparently a kitten is worse than a literal human organ? i do not understand it! please fix this.  It just happened again, it was a roblox story with my friends, it was taken down for minor safety and harassment and bullying. It was about how many words you have, seriously? fix this. I already have an account warning for stupid stuff like this. My tiktok account is Jxd3nz, if this happens again i’m deleting this app."
