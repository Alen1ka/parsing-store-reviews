        "review": "This app is so good, it\u2019s almost perfect. It has nutrition, activity, water, and measurement tracking, plus a notes section with a good variety of tags that serve as a mood journal/symptom tracker of sorts. With pro, I also have Fitbit integration and a fasting tracker. Put that all together and this app really meets all of my needs and took 2-3 apps out of my rotation, all replaced by this one. \n\nI only say it\u2019s almost perfect because I would love two things, they\u2019re minor but would be great. I would love to have more flexibility in the fasting schedules/tracking. Nothing longer than 16:8 is kinda on the light side for people who are already used to regular IF. An option to input a custom fasting schedule would be perfect but the addition of 18:6 and 20:4/OMAD (one meal a day) would be fantastic. ADF (alternate day fasting) is not my jam but they have several options for that as well, though I can\u2019t attest to the variety.\n\nThe other thing that would be great is an increased variety of tags in the Note section. Again the option to add custom ones would be marvelous but just more tags so that I can track a wider breadth of moods and symptoms would be helpful.",

I have the free version so they may be better on the subscription version.\n But, for one it\u2019s hard to determine exactly where it is deriving the caloric limit from and it doesn\u2019t automatically update with weight loss or gain, you must manually recalculate each time. Then, it doesn\u2019t tell you the exact calories you have expended for the day (even wearing an Apple Watch), it just gives you a goal to burn each day based on information entered in to the bio. \nI have yet to determine what the color of the circle for each day indicates since there is no explanation for that. \nAlso, I\u2019ve yet to come across any of my foods that have the barcode information entered into their food database. A lot of the foods I'm scanning are common foods.  It\u2019s extremely time consuming and frustrating to have to enter all the information about every ingredient in each meal in manually. It also only gives a few options for serving sizes instead of multiple options. Most of the serving sizes on the packaging of my foods don\u2019t even match up with one of the serving size options given. \nLastly, the app crashes on my iPhone X every time I try to search for a food. This is by far the most frustrating issue I\u2019ve had with it. If it crashes every time I try to enter my food, how am I supposed to actually track my calories?",

I was so impressed with the quality of it that I only had it a day before choosing to upgrade to the membership.\nHowever, with that being said, there are a few small issues. I tried to find a way to reach out to the dev team or request to beta test in order to address or troubleshoot these issues, but couldn\u2019t find that. My first issue is that the watch app of YAZIO always presents an error when trying to sign up or sign in, specifically through Apple ID, which is what I\u2019m signed up with on my phone app. It still connects to my Health data, but I want to access the app on my wrist too. The second issue is part of why I opted into a membership, so it\u2019s disappointing it isn\u2019t working- the Health/Food Coach option to create my own meal plan always presents a 404 error no matter what options are chosen. The last issue might not be a YAZIO issue (possibly a Siri issue), but the Siri shortcuts don\u2019t seem to do anything.\nOverall, I\u2019m still happy with my purchase bc it\u2019s super easy to monitor so many aspects of my food intake, water, and activity while being easy-to-understand.",

This is by far the best diet aid app I have found and I\u2019ve been through many trying to find the perfect one. It has everything you need all in one and there\u2019s no hidden charges like others. What I especially like about this app is their extensive recipes, one thing I struggle with as an athlete is getting enough, good, calories and the recipes have helped tremendously as they are all light wholesome ingredients (perfect for an active lifestyle). Another great aspect is their new addition for notes so that way you can track how you are feeling if you are in a new diet or if you just want to decompress.

        "review": "I got a new phone and downloaded YAZIO which I paid subscription till May but on new phone it won\u2019t let me see recipes.  I can\u2019t find away to contact, at first it wouldn\u2019t let me log in and when I would request help with password you all would not send password.  So I had to dig through my passwords till I found it so it loaded info from profile but not completely correctly I had to go in an edit plus it didn\u2019t load any old data.\n\nAs far as the app goes I prefer my fitness pal.  This has a lot of incorrect data if you compare nutritional data on packaging to app.  Plus if you try to input new food a lot of times it will give you a stupid message (I can\u2019t remember exactly how it\u2019s worded) but essentially it tells you nutritional data doesn\u2019t add up to serving.  I feel my fitness pal is more user friendly.  The only thing I like better is the note section so you can track moods or health from day to day.  Oh and calories burnt don\u2019t match with other sources, I tried to online sources and a book, at least 2 of them match but rarely does YAZIO info match.  At first I thought maybe I will like it better if I use it longer, I\u2019m on my second year because I forgot to cancel subscription before it was deducted but like I mentioned before I can\u2019t use recipes on new phone so if not correctly I have no reason to continue with this app.",

This was more difficult with MyFitnessPal.  They have a FB support and the people are super supportive and helpful in that group.  \n\nThe not so good. Adding a recipe had to be done manually. You can\u2019t import one from the web like you can with MyFitnessPal. I am not sure I trust their calorie calculator. There is a coaching app to support intermittent fasting and offer different challenges. This would be good except it doesn\u2019t work well for vegans or vegetarians. It includes lots of menu suggestions and recipes but not for vegans. There are a few vegan recipes but there are not very good. Would not make again. The whole coaching aspect is bad for me because it keeps telling me to eat animals (vegan for 20 years). \n\nBottom line, what I paid the extra money for is useless for vegans and vegetarians. Only benefit over MyFitnessPal is the water tracker. If I knew that I would have saved my money.",

With the help of this app, I have been able to get the proper amount of calories I need for my goal AND I get a step counter and calories burned counter. This app does all the math for me and I am no longer struggling with my calorie counting like I was before this app. In 2 weeks I have gained almost 6 pounds of almost 100% pure muscle. This app has made it easy to meet daily goals with reminders and helpful tools throughout the app. The recipe ideas are also helpful even if you don\u2019t have the pro membership.",

The things I really like about this are (1) it makes really good use of its Apple Watch app, way more than MyFitnessPal, and (2) it\u2019s a much cleaner look. With MyFitnessPal I always hated how the initial screen was basically an ad for their other products, despite having paid for the full subscription. \n\nThe downside of YAZIO is that the database doesn\u2019t seem as full, although so far it has been pretty good. The bigger frustration I\u2019ve run into is that when I tried to add foods that weren\u2019t in the database I got an error saying that my calories didn\u2019t match what the macronutrients were, despite the fact that they were definitely what the label said. \n\nAt $22 per year so far it\u2019s definitely been worth trying out.

Oof, this one is a big one. If you\u2019re the kind of person who has success with straight calorie tracking as opposed to food category restriction (which is just a convoluted way to get to calorie restriction), then you should be familiar with BMR calculations.\n\nMy BMR is about 2500 Calories when sedentary, and and activity beyond that raises my caloric needs. This app adds movement Calories from Apple Watch, Fitbit etc. That\u2019s great! But... they add movement Calories into your baseline!\n\nWhat does this mean? If I want to lose 1lb a week, I should be eating 2000 Calories plus more for movement. But this app starts me at 2500 and THEN adds my movement Calories. So if so burn 500 on average, this app says I should eat 3000... or 3500 if I want to maintain weight.\n\nYou can set caloric goals manually, but if you\u2019re going to try counting calories with this app, you\u2019re going to maintain or gain weight, not lose. This app isn\u2019t the only one to do this, but given how good the interface is for straight calorie counters... it\u2019s just frustrating.\n\nSo just don\u2019t rely on their Calorie goal calculator, do a BMR calculation online and remember 500C/day is 1lb/week, then go from there.",

The nutritional info is different among the options as well. \n\nAlso, you may find several choices for the same frozen dinner - with different values, apparently based on whatever users submit. \n\nNavigating the myriad of options is very frustrating. \n\nAs for support - I used the app for a few weeks before deciding to purchase the pro version. I used the pro features for a few weeks when suddenly all of my info was gone. Support took almost a week to respond and told me that because I didn\u2019t register when I first downloaded the app, my purchase ended up wiping everything out. They did not address the fact I had been using the app for a few weeks under my pro subscription. \n\nSo now I have to start all over - and, of course, give them all my information to track me with and/or sell to marketers.\n\nI\u2019ll use it for now, but will be looking for something with more accurate nutritional info and fewer than a dozen options to say \u2018I ate an egg.\u2019",

So far, I find the app absolutely fantastic. The UI is clean and simple, the tracking feels accurate, and the logging is very nice. I\u2019m starting to feel like a permanent convert!\n\nHowever, there is one significant issue: the \u201cAdd Food\u201d capability. It certainly makes sense that the food library is smaller than some apps that have been on the market longer. I can\u2019t fault them for that, and have been more than willing to take the time to add foods to their library that I eat and can find the nutritional info for. The issue is that there\u2019s no way to \u201cname\u201d a standard serving. This makes adding food, or logging food another user added, extremely difficult.\n\nI understand that it\u2019s oz based, but some menus don\u2019t provide caloric info based on the oz\u2019s of, say, rolls. They tell you how many calories are in a roll! If they offered the user the chance to rename a \u201cstandard portion\u201d to something more useful (for example, \u201c1 Roll\u201d) it\u2019d make the database so much more useful!\n\nOther than that, the app is fantastic, but this ends up being a bit of a deal breaker. I don\u2019t want to have to add custom foods every time because I can\u2019t figure out what other uses used for their \u201cstandard portion\u201d baseline.",

It seems no one is checking all this data, resulting on a public database with lots of duplicated items, different nutrition facts for the same item, and misleading info.

Even foods identified by brand are wrong. Not even standard measurements are correct. Sometimes a cup is listed as 4 oz sometimes 3.5, sometimes something else. Last time I checked, a cup is 8 oz.

Your body burns calories all day not just during an active state. But YAZIO only tracks and displays the active calories burned. So if you walked 10 miles in a day, without your heart rate reaching an \u201cactive state\u201d they WILL NOT COUNT IT. Which of course left me with a LOT of calories burned that weren\u2019t counting on the app so after logging my meals for the day it would turn red and say I\u2019ve eaten over my goal, when in fact I had been eating at too high of a deficit. This is dangerous to eat at too high of a deficit and therefore I find the tracking hazardous. You read that right. You will put your health at risk if you trust this apps calculations. I use a Garmin Venu which displays my active and inactive calories burned. Many other health trackers show this as well. Proceed with caution using this app. \n\nBest regards,\n a PRO user.",

Given I often use the tool to plan my next meal ahead of time, not being able to see my daily overview while in a meal is a challenge. Also, the scrolling units entry feature is frustrating. If the default is 1 ounce, but I want to enter 7 grams, I scroll the number 1 to a 7, then the Ounces unit to Grams. When I change the units, the number scrolls back and resets at 1, forcing me to have to scroll the number back to 7 again. Hopefully they\u2019ll address these issues and make the tool easier to navigate and make it easier to make entries.  Overall, still useful and robust.",

Also there are only 4 meals, I wish I could customize the meal number or like in MyFitnessPal it gives pre workout meal plus 5 meals.

I unselected visible to others. Went to select and was only given weight options such as gram/ounce. How about sandwich or serving size large, medium or small.

Everything I\u2019ve tried to input into this database to add to my food diary couldn\u2019t be found whereas MFP had no troubles. \n\nThe portion sizing is just weird. Ounces or grams are the only things you have available and sometimes it\u2019s just wrong! I tried to put in an 8oz cup of hit chocolate into my food diary and it said it was over 900 calories! But if it kept it at the ounce it was correct. Completely inaccurate. \n\nI also don\u2019t like how it tracks weight. I\u2019m attempting to lose weight and having a visual chart the tracks your progress over the days, weeks, months, is pretty nice, but with this you only input your weight based on when you weigh yourself. It doesn\u2019t track the progress or the ups and downs. \n\nThe interface is nice and I like the design, but there are a few things that it needs to work on before I truly commit to this app. Also, they need to not try to tear another company down if they can\u2019t back up their claims. It\u2019s just tacky and disappointing",

I just switched to Apple Watch a couple months ago and haven\u2019t found an adequate app to sync the Apple Watch to the Fitbit app so YAZIO is doing a decent job of filling the gap.

However, it is missing some key elements:\n\n1) when adding in a food (bc the database is not that large) you should be able to add in measurements other than grams/ounces/ the \u201cother\u201d options they give you. The standard serving of a snack I was trying to add was 13 \u201cclusters\u201d but this app doesn\u2019t allow you to make your own measurements\n\n2) the fact that the amount of sugar in a food is something you have to PAY to see is ridiculous. I can\u2019t think of another app that does this. Sugar should be included with all the other nutrients and ingredients, not behind a paywall. I don\u2019t consider a single nutrient a premium feature you should have to pay for\n\n3) for the fasting options, let us create our own custom app as well! \n\nThat\u2019s all the quibbles I have for now :) if these things get changed (primarily the first two) I can\u2019t see why I\u2019d ever go back to mfp",

I\u2019ll be sure to check out the app again in a few months. I wish you well \ud83d\ude01\n\nOLD REVIEW: Just let me try the app without all the questions and making an account\n\nI just downloaded a bunch of tracking apps because I\u2019m trying to find something that will easily let me visually see photos of what I ate. Bonus that this one seemed to do that, in addition seems to track calories, so it could also replace MFP for me.\n\nI just wanted to try the app, but first, I had to answer a bunch of personal questions \ud83d\ude11 Then, I make it through all the questions, THEN I find out I have to start an account and give you my email address. Mind you, I still haven\u2019t even been able to try the app to see if I want to use it. I was about to delete it, and came back here to leave a one star rating for making me go through all the questions and then springing the account thing on me, when I saw the app looked really good, so I decided to try it. \n\nI entered my spam email address, and finally, I was in. I got through the pop ups, and started to enter my breakfast. First food: eggs. Searched that, and it has a photo of...a chicken leg \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nOk, well, whatever, I mainly came for a photo diary, which it looks like you can do based on the photos. However, I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. Admittedly, I didn\u2019t try that hard, but it wasn\u2019t intuitive. \n\nThe pros of this app is it has a much more attractive UI than MFP, but less in the database. If there is actually a way to add photos, that would be a pro. It would be better suited to those who don\u2019t know how to lose weight/what to eat, because the app seems to tell you that. I know what to eat, I just need a way to track foods and see photos in a visually pleasing way. This app isn\u2019t for me, but not every thing is for everyone, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nThe app itself might be about 3-4 stars, but this is a protest review against not just letting me try the app without tricking me into going through all those questions before making an account. If I had just been able to try the app, I would not have left a review unless it was going to be 5 stars. Please be considerate of people\u2019s time while they are trying to search for an app and let them quickly try it. Thanks for considering it and taking the time to read this. It does look like this app looks promising (for what it\u2019s intended to do). I wish you well :)",

        "review": "There are things to like about this app. I like the clean look, the automatic calorie count for the amount of weight to lose, the customer service is responsive to my emails, and the intermittent fasting timer is something I would use. I paid for the yearly pro version. There are deal breakers for me. The first is the coach shows different recipes to swap out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I actually like a lot of the recipes. The thing is that with most of the recipes, they don't give you the amounts for some of the foods like oz, tbl, tsps, nothing. So how can you make the recipe and keep the calorie count in check if you don't know how much of an ingredient to add to the recipe? Then the breakfast, lunch, and dinner suggestions in the coach section (which only works if you buy the pro version) do not add up to your particular calorie allotment for the day. So my allotment is supposed to be 3 meals a day @ 1,800 calories with no snacks. That is 900 calories per meal. The coach section has suggestions of meals that equal 450 calories and some of the suggestions are just for things like keto bread for 250 calories. I need 900 calories per meal. Show me those, not 250 or 400 calorie meals or just parts of meals Who is just going to eat some slices of bread for lunch or dinner? Not me for sure. If they would fix these parts of the app, I could use this app for years to come. This app in its current state is totally uselesss to me and I suspect some others. Please fix this. I cancelled my subscription and will rejoin if you fix it.",

I\u2019ve used MyFitnessPal, Lifesum and other competitive apps but ended up preferring this one, for several reasons. \n\nHere\u2019s some things they do well:\n\n- No need to sign-in: your data is private (unlike MyFitnessPal, who sells you like cattle), and integrates with Apple Health wonderfully\n- Helpful notifications that don\u2019t feel irksome! They really focus on your health, instead of marketing to you. \n- Very understandable interface: I never feel lost in the app\n- Siri integration makes it easy to add food without navigating the app. I use this feature extensively!\n\nHere\u2019s a few things that I\u2019d like to see improve:\n\n- Measurements for a meal seem unnatural: the base measurement is set to 1 oz. This is a helpful measurement overall, but it would make more sense for a single serving size to be the default meal size.\n- Adding a new food to the database feels tedious. I\u2019m sorry for being nebulous here, but when adding nutritional information from a cooking website or using nutrition panel for a purchased meal/restaurant website, it would be much easier to input accurate information if the app more closely mirrored the source, specifically with regards to serving size options. \n- The food database is still maturing, so finding a decent match to a meal can be a bit of a chore, and there are many duplicates with incomplete info. That can sometimes throw you off your calorie tracking. \n\nKeep up the great work, YAZIO team.",

        "review": "\u2026 if the functionality met my expectations based on initial use of the platform. I love the set up, I love the themes, I love the widget options, and I love that it is a food AND fasting tracker. The presentation is really gorgeous, and I love that the fasting timer keeps me informed at what stage I\u2019m at. I want so badly for this app to work for me. \n\nBut the fasting timer leaves so much to be desired. When you want to manually enter your time, you hit hard stops and have to go in and adjust the start or stop time several times over. For example, I start my fast time. I\u2019m set for a 20:4 fast. I start the fast at 10pm - it\u2019s hard stopping so that I can\u2019t have a fast end time any later than 3:59pm. 4pm rolls around, I still am fasting, and my tracker says I\u2019m eating. I then have to go in and manually adjust my fast end time - but still reach hard stops. This is a MAJOR flaw, there have been requests to adjust it in the app FAQ, and considering how smooth other fasting trackers work, I don\u2019t see how this can\u2019t have been addressed already. \n\nAdditionally, the food database is relatively weak. The serving sizes in the app don\u2019t correlate with serving sizes for some of the scanned items. For example: one serving of peanut butter is 2 tablespoons by the nutrition label. Tracker automatically sets to 1 serving - but the calorie information for 1 \u201cserving\u201d is actually 2 servings worth (190 calories for 1 serving on nutrition label; 380 calories for 1 serving on app). I\u2019ve noticed this with many different barcodes I\u2019ve scanned, and I\u2019ve just wound up adjusting calories to what the nutrition label serving size indicates. This is cumbersome and feels like it shouldn\u2019t be so. Also, a large amount of servings seem to revert to \u201c1 ounce,\u201d but there\u2019s no good reason for this - it\u2019s almost never actually a 1 ounce serving. This can seriously impact those who don\u2019t pay attention and wind up thinking they\u2019re eating more or less calories than they actually are. \n\nThere should also be some sort of toggle to view extra calories allotted for activity or just to keep a straight calorie limit regardless of activity. I wind up with way more calories than I need at the end of the day and if I\u2019m not undershooting my recommended intake after my activity has been accounted for, I\u2019m plateauing weight wise. \n\nI haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to continue my subscription to this app. I love it on SO many levels, and when I first found it it looked like exactly what I wanted - fasting and food tracking in one place. If they addressed some of these issues - which seem like basic and intuitive things for what the app intends - I would hands down be 5 star happy with this. I want to be. There are so many great aspects of this app - but these issues are kind of a big deal for how the app is expected to perform.",

        "review": "I\u2019ve used MyFitnessPal, LoseIt and Yazio and Yazio is the worst of the bunch. The food database is the smallest by far so I find myself having to add food more often than not. On top of that, the foods that are in the database almost always have incorrect serving / portion sizes. This may be because the interface for entering a new food is really weird and bad. It seems impossible to have the app understand what a serving is. And, if you enter one incorrectly (due to the bad interface, probably) and make it public, there is no option at all to edit or remove it.  \n\nAnother quirk related to portion sizes is that the app doesn\u2019t offer many conversions for you when adding food that already exists in the database. For instance, if it says \u201counces\u201d on an item, you can\u2019t change that to grams. This, combined with the fact that the portion size in the app is almost certainly wrong, often had me just typing in numbers randomly until the calories lined up with what I\u2019d expect. \n\nI made the mistake of purchasing a pro account because a lot of these issues were less apparent in the first few days (and they were offering a deal on subscriptions). I definitely regret it, but they\u2019re pretty transparent on their website that they don\u2019t offer refunds (and, since I purchased through them and not the App Store I really have no recourse). \n\nI\u2019d recommend staying away from this one and trying one of the options I mentioned above instead. The interface is cool and unique, but the actual functionality is lacking.",

The free version is basically useless, and I tried upgrading to the paid version thinking it would be better. Wrong!\n\nSo the paid version provides meal plans. This means it gives you recipes. I got two a day. A sample menu as laid out in this app for me in a full day includes no breakfast, whole wheat rolls for lunch (~200 calories) and a quinoa and fruit bowl for dinner (~300 calories). And it constantly sends me reminders to drink water if I\u2019m hungry. Seriously? At 500 calories a day with basically no protein, no vegetables, and no fat of course I\u2019d be starving. The point of this is to stay healthy, not starve myself. \n\nThe food list only allows you to input most foods in ounces. A pat of butter? Better figure it out in ounces! Half an Apple? Nope, ounces. A teaspoon of anything? You won\u2019t be able to find it. There\u2019s an option to scan a barcode but I haven\u2019t scanned a single item in my entire kitchen that came up correctly. My fitness pal is free and has way better functionality. \n\nI\u2019m also a picky eater. I tried to swap the recipes but it would only cycle through the same 5 meals. For the week. None of them looked appealing and in most cases were not appropriate for meals. Who eats just rye bread for dinner? I\u2019ve already cancelled the subscription and have been trying to get my money back for days, but the customer service department seems even more pointless than the app. Don\u2019t waste your time.

For example my carbs are set to 192g which is 768 calories (4calories per gram) but that app displays that as being 785 calories.

But it has its negative side. There're soooo many similar options to choose from with different numbers of kcal and etc. that I can't choose any, because I don't know which of them is right. I understand that they are added by users, but can you actually add a filter or something like that to delete unnecessary stuff ? That'd be such a relief. \nOne more thing. In my country we use kilograms instead of pounds and I'm used to it. Here I must change my weight measurement to lb. every single time I try to add it to my diary. I'm sick and tired.

It wasn't in the database, even though it was from a huge chain with easily accessible nutrition info. To add it, I had to categorize it (either a bread or a roll, imo), enter its mass, and input its macro- and micronutrients. Micronutrients included both salt and sodium (!), which had to be entered in units of grams (!!), and the usual complement of vitamins, minerals, and metals, which had to be entered in mg (!!!). These are ludicrous choices that make one wonder how knowledgeable the app builders are. They also ensure that user-input foods will essentially all have inaccurate data, since people are unlikely to put in the effort to get everything in the units the app wants.",

Keeps logs for you in numerous areas, weight activity etc. But you need to connect to another app you have for that.There is a recipe section which if you are vegetarian may appeal to you. I\u2019ve tried a handful of recipes and they are not bad just needed ingredients I do not typically have. The app has a barcode scanner which is helpful , however the information often contradicts itself. Particularly in the quantity/ calorie area. Annoying but you can sort of figure it out I just feel I shouldn\u2019t have to. The epic fail of the program is the inability to get real information on your vitamin and mineral intake. I take supplements, the app reads the barcode no problem, but DOES NOT add the ingredients to your list. So what is the point? A terrible flaw which I had to pay money to find out.

        "review": "I love YAZIO and it has completely revolutionized my eating habits with the support of the Apple Watch I got for Christmas. Unfortunately, there are several issues that have wasted hours of my time and created many headaches for me. Given the price of the app, I expected more: \n\n- Completely broken Apple Watch complications that show only the logo.\n\n- Imprecise recipes that have quantities listed by ounce instead of by cups, teaspoons, and the like. Some quantities are so small that they show up as 0 oz which gives no clue about how much of the ingredient to add. \n\n- Broken per meal calorie allotments that show only zeroes for each recommended amount. \n\n- Inability to add certain types of nutritional information (e.g. added sugar) when creating new foods.\n\n- No quality control/review process for user added foods. Most of the time, I create a new version of each food from scratch because 8 times out of 10, the user-contributed one is inaccurate. \n\n- I would have preferred to send this all to a support line/customer service representative to get help, but they don\u2019t seem to have any such thing. The support link takes you to an incomplete FAQ page with no way to problem solve or get feedback from an actual human. That\u2019s a big red flag, and something I hope they remedy in the future. \n\nAs a US-based user, I understand that some of the issues with the app might have to do with the fact that it is geared toward a German/international audience. The app has already been so helpful to me, and it has the potential to be great if they expand their features to make it more compatible with US measurements etc.",

        "review": "Looked good at first. However, I can\u2019t bring myself to support a company that uses sly bait and switch tactics to get people to buy their product. \n\nWhen you first set up YAZIO through the apple App Store, and go through the initial steps to set up, it brings you to select \u201cpro\u201d or standard. Pro has a standard price of $29.99 when purchasing through the app with no trial and standard is free. I decided to wait until I did more research. Then YAZIO sent me a discount coupon to my email somehow, even though I didn\u2019t select to receive emails from them. It was a coupon for 20% off. I clicked it and it took me to their website where they try to show that their standard price for Pro is $3.75 per month but it\u2019s on sale for $3.00. Well that equals $36 a year. So apparently the 20% \u201cdiscount\u201d ends up costing you $6 more than through the app. Otherwise known as \u201cbait and switch tactics\u201d. The developers figure this will go right over your head. Not the end of the world over $6, but not honest business. Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be doing business with them and apple should know that they are leading others away from their site with these deceitful tactics. Just felt others should be aware. \n\nI have screenshots to share but don\u2019t know how to do that in these reviews.",

I was scrolling through the instructions for the app mindlessly because I was tired after a long day. All of a sudden the Face ID screen popped up, I thought it was a little weird, but I was tired so I automatically double clicked the power button. Then a message appeared thanking me for my purchase... I was shocked to find out that the app had charged me $29.99 for a \u201cpro\u201d subscription. I looked around the app thinking maybe the pro subscription would be beneficial, but I was wrong. The pro subscription is something you could get on another app for free, so I contacted the app\u2019s support to try to get a refund. The company replied saying that I had made a binding contract with them, so they couldn\u2019t refund my accidental purchase. The response from customer service was also very automated, I doubt a living person actually read my concern. Anyway, I\u2019m upset that I paid 30 whole dollars for nothing special.

Sin embrago por lo que le pongo 4 estrellas es porque para la versi\u00f3n gratuita no hay muchas funciones mas q anotar tus comidas.",

The only problem is most of the foods I've searched for are not in their database.  I've taken the (not so short) steps to add three today only.  I think this needs a little time to get a varied user base to get that data.",
